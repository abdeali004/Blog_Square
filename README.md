- Blog Square is a blogging site which targets different people with different mindset to explore, grow and share their own piece of knowledge.


# Note for the users

- I created this website to see how Medium and GeeksForGeeks works and how the database works in these blogging wesites. 
- Now i want you to upgrade it, as per your creativity and own ideas.
- The pages like register code may crash because they work on email service.  So before running the project kindly give the credentials of your gmail account in settings(at last emailId & Password).
- I recommend you to create a dummy gmail account for this project.
- In start the code will seems to be bit complex to understand but i know you will get it.
